## Overview

Edit code cells, write markdown, visualize!

Checkout our [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/nteract/nteract-revolutionizing-the-notebook-experience-d106ca5d2c38) to see what amazing things you can do with nteract.

Note: There will be :bug:s and quirks. Please come tell us about them!

nteract is a literate coding environment that supports Python, R, JavaScript and [other Jupyter kernels](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages). It wraps up the best of the web based Jupyter notebook and embeds it as a desktop application that allows you to open notebooks natively on your system. Double click a `.ipynb` on the desktop, use Spotlight on the Mac. It Just Works™

### Scope and goals

* Notebook environment to explore and get things done ✅
* Standalone cross-platform desktop application ✅
* One notebook document/narrative per window ✅
* Work with any Jupyter kernel using message spec v5 ✅
* Easy install with pre-configured Python3 and JavaScript runtimes ❌
* Grow an ecosystem of tooling to allow others to build their own platforms relying on the Jupyter specifications 🔜

## Installation - Users

### Development

To get started developing install a [python runtime](#python-runtime) then install [`nteract` in dev mode](#install-nteract-in-dev-mode).

#### Python runtime

At least for now, we need the python 3 kernel installed when hacking on nteract:

```
python3 -m pip install ipykernel
python3 -m ipykernel install --user
```

#### Install `nteract` in dev mode

Requires [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone it `git clone https://github.com/nteract/nteract`
3. `cd` to where you `clone`d it
4. `npm install`
5. `npm run start`

As you make changes, close the entire app (cmd-q on OS X, or ctrl-c at the terminal) then run `npm run start` again.

##### Progressive Webpack build for the notebook

In separate terminals run:

```
npm run build:main
npm run build:renderer:watch
```

and

```
npm run spawn
```

The webpack build will keep occurring as you modify source. When you open a new notebook, you'll get the freshest copy of the notebook app.

#### Build Documentation
You can run nteract's documentation generator by running

```
npm run build:docs
```

And then opening `docs/index.html` in your favorite browser.

#### Troubleshooting

> I upgraded my developer installation and things are broken!

- Try `npm run reinstall`

> I want to debug redux actions and state changes.

-  Enable [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger) by spawning the application with `npm run spawn:debug`.

## For maintainers: Creating a release

### Bump the version

```
npm version {major|minor|patch}
git push
git push --tags
npm publish
```

### Create the package

It is recommended to run `npm run reinstall` before packaging a release.

To package a release for your current platform run:
```
npm run dist
```

To package a release for all platforms run:
```
npm run dist:all
```
Make sure you have the [required dependencies](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Multi-Platform-Build) for a multi platform build installed.

The OS X release has to be signed with an Apple developer key. Currently only
Kyle (@rgbkrk) has this set up.

Then verify that the copy of nteract in `dist/` works
properly (mostly ad-hoc basic notebook loading and execution).
